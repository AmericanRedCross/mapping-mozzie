# Safety
Don't start this project unless you know what you are doing, and know how to do it safely. It is not feasible to fully address proper safety practices here, but below are a few safety reminders:

## Battery Safety
* Lipo batteries can be very dangerous, even when they are not being used. Make sure you know what you are doing and take proper safety precautions. They can unexpectedly combust and start **dangerous fires (with dangerous smoke)**.
* Never charge them unattended.
* Always store them in a safe place in something like an ammo box and at a proper storage charge.
* If one catches fire, do not use water. Use sand or an appropriate fire extinguisher. Don't breathe the smoke.
* Transport in lipo safe bags. Transport in a carry-on bag that you can monitor.
* Check FAA, international and airline requirements for batteries. [Example](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/lithium-batteries-more-100-watt-hours): "One spare battery, not exceeding 300 watt hours, or two spare batteries, not exceeding 160 watt hours each, are permitted in carry-on bags". (Watt hours = volts * amp hours)

## Build Safety

* Always wear eye protection
* Guard against injuries from tools, sharp edges, and moving parts (especially propellers).
* Prevent burns, especially from heat guns and soldering irons. Also beware of heat resulting from machining, electrical currents, etc. Keep hot items away from other items that can catch fire.
* When working with carbon fiber, protect skin, eyes, and lungs.
* Protect yourself from soldering fumes.
