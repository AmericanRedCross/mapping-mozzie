## Screws, nuts, spacers
This page only lists extra hardware to purchase; it does not list hardware included with other purchases.  
Ideally everything on this list should be metric, but the initial build was done with hardware that was on-hand.

more nylon spacers are [available here](https://www.pololu.com/category/93/spacers).

Spacers allow tightening the screws without crushing the fuselage. Also, being larger in diameter than the screws, they distribute the lateral and rotational forces better than the screws alone. Here are rough thicknesses for the fuselage in various locations:

* 10mm or .4" at the front quadarm
* 27mm or 1.1" at the read quadarm
* 10mm or .4" at the camera mount
