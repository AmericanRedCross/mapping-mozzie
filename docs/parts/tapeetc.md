## Tape
[This "ScotchÂ® Extreme Shipping Tape" is what was on-hand](https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/717151/Scotch-Extreme-Shipping-Tape-With-Dispenser/). Twenty-one yards is overkill, you won't need much. Other tapes will probably work fine. This tape is used to attach items to the inside of the fuselage and to cover items on the wings, including:

* airspeed sensor tubing,
* receiver antennas,
* servos (cover on wing),
* GPS (cover on wing)


## Glue
["Gorilla Clear Grip Contact Adhesive" was used on the initial build](https://www.amazon.com/Gorilla-Clear-Contact-Adhesive-Waterproof/dp/B06WGSRM4Z). It is [recommended here](https://www.itsqv.com/QVM/index.php?title=X-UAV_Mini_Talon_Build_Compilation#First_-_It.27s_all_about_Glue). This amount is overkill. Other glues will work fine. The original Mozzie used UHU Por glue. Glued items include:

* internal wooden frame,
* spacers,
* airspeed pitot tube to bracket,
* airspeed pitot tube tip,
* airframe pieces: wings, tail, fuselage halves, motor mount, carbon rods, servos, servo control horns.


## Velcro Tape
[VELCRO Brand - Industrial Strength | Indoor & Outdoor Use | Superior Holding Power on Smooth Surfaces](https://www.amazon.com/VELCRO-Brand-Industrial-Fasteners-Professional/dp/B00006IC2U/). Others will probably work fine. Velcro tape is used to attach items to the  airframe (mainly the inside of the fuselage), including:

* the air speed sensor (just the board)
* the receiver (just the board)
* the radio modem RFD900
* the plane ESC
* Battery(s) along with velcro straps
* GPS (to wing) (?)
* Raspberry Pi (to camera)

Velcro tape can also be used along the inside of the fuselage to create wiring harnesses.
