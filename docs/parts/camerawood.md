## Camera mount wood

The camera mount was fabricated using 3mm thick plywood, bought from a local [hobby store](https://www.michaels.com/revell-birch-plywood-sheet-3mmx6inx12in/10307259.html).

2 of the camera mount plates are 66mm x 58mm. A third camera mount plate is 86mm x 58mm.

An alternative is to 3D print the camera plates from the files in this project.
