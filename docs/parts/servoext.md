## Servo Lead Extension Cables

Servo lead extension cables 30cm.  (JR plug type connectors) with Hook 26AWG (5pcs/bag).

Need 8, so 2 bags of 5 will work, $3 per bag.

* 4 are used for the servos.
* 4 are used for the quad ESCs.

Can probably get away with some [shorter (15cm) cables](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/150mm-servo-lead-extension-jr-with-hook-26awg-5pcs-bag.html), per the original Mozzie.
