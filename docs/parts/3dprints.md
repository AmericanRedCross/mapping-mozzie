## 3D prints
There were twenty-seven [3D printed parts on the original mozzie](https://mozzie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GettingStarted.html#d-printed-parts), but we avoided 3D printing for the initial build of this aircraft. Instead we opted to use parts that are included with the airframe as well as simpler shapes that can  easily be cut and drilled. In particular you can fabricate or purchase the [camera plates](../tasks/cameraplates.md), the [brackets](../tasks/bracket_prep.md), and the [motor hole template](../tasks/quadarm_prep.md). However, the project contains the following STL files in the 3D folder for those who prefer 3D printing:

* camera_plate_bottom.stl
* camera_plate_mid.stl
* camera_plate_top.stl
* bracket_large.stl
* bracket_small.stl (<- print two)
* motor_hole_template.stl


Many other good 3D part designs are at [ItsQv.com](https://www.itsqv.com/QVM/index.php?title=Parts_Catalog_-_Mini_Talon) (examples: [blade stop](http://www.itsqv.com/QVM/index.php?title=How_To_-_Set-Up_a_Pusher_Style_Folding_Prop#3D_Printed_Insert) and [battery strap guide](https://www.itsqv.com/QVM/index.php?title=Parts_Catalog_-_Mini_Talon#Battery_Strap_Guide)), and on the [original mozzie](https://mozzie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GettingStarted.html#d-printed-parts).
