## On-board companion computer
Raspberry Pi version 4 Model B 2GB RAM, purchased from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4292)

85x56x17

Is 2GB of RAM adequate (at $35)? 4 GB is $55, 8 GB is $75.

See the [BEC page](bec.md) for notes on power.

The Raspberry Pi Zero W is smaller and lighter (9 gm) but less powerful and requires more work to install.
