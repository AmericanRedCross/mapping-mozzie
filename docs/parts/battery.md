Qty 1 of Turnigy LiPo 4S 10Ah, 902 gm, dimensions 168 x 69 x 38 mm. $90. [HobbyKing](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-high-capacity-10000mah-4s-12c-multi-rotor-lipo-pack-w-xt90.html)

* 4 Cell
* 14.8V (each cell is 3.7V nominal, 4.2V max, 3.8V storage)
* Max charge rate: 2C (or 2* capacity). It may be better to charge at 1C, so 1C * 10Ah = 10 Amps.

[Battery velcro straps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MZYWQ3L/). These can also be used to temporarily hold the fuselage together.  

One alternative is to use a quantity of 2 of 5Ah batteries connected in parallel when you fly the mini talon. Two 5Ah batteries can be brought on a commercial flight (but verify this before flying). Connecting two identical batteries in parallel for mapping flights doubles the capacity (Amp-hours) while keeping the voltage the same. Important: If you do this, use *identical* batteries. This includes making sure they are of the same age and condition, which starts with buying them together, at the same time.
