## Micro SD Card

This is the micro SD Card for the Raspberry Pi computer. It stores all files and the operating system OS. You will lose all pre-existing data on the SD card.

(the adapter is not needed)

(not sure what capacity is needed for data/photos. 8gb are needed for the Rasspberry Pi OS, etc.)

Note: there is a separate micro SD card needed for the Pixhawk 4, which is included with the [pixhawk 4 bundle](flightcontroller.md).
