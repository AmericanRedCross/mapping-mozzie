## BEC Prep

1. Make sure the jumper is set to 5V, per the BEC instructions. You might have to stretch the heat shrink with some tweezers to make it fit.
2.  For each BEC, wrap the output wires (with servo plug) around the included ferrite core per the instructions included with the BEC (wrap 5x).

An XT30 connector will be soldered to the bare wires on the input side of the BEC at a separate step, [XT to Parts](xtparts.md).
