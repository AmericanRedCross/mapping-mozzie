## Mapping Mozzie #
This project describes a quadplane mapping drone that is meant to be useful to the [American Red Cross and others](https://americanredcross.github.io/rcrc-drones/activities.html). The goal is an affordable mapping drone that is easy to build, service and repair.

A quadplane was chosen because it combines vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) with good range. Another benefit of a quadplane is redundancy: if the plane has issues the quad motors can take over, and vice versa. This project borrows heavily from the [Mozzie quadplane](https://mozzie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). There are many alternatives, like a [a *tiltrotor* mini talon](https://www.itsqv.com/QVM/index.php?title=X-UAV_Mini_Talon_VTOL_Project#Introduction), or a [tail sitter](https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/guide-tailsitter.html) which might be less robust and less stable, while being simpler and cheaper with only two motors and two servos.

This project requires knowledge including robotics, aviation and fabrication. However, the documentation is meant to be useful to novices. The build avoids special tools & equipment.

The documentation has these primary sections:

**[Parts](/parts/partslist/)**: Most parts have their own document listing purchase options, specs, alternatives, etc

**[Tasks](/tasks/taskorder/)**: Each task is meant to contain a bite-sized list of steps. Many tasks can be done concurrently, as indicated on the task list. This can speed production if the build is being done by a team.

**[Tools, supplies, ground items](toolsetc.md)**: Lists other things you might need, from a transmitter to paper towels.

**[Safety](safety.md)**: This is the most important section.
