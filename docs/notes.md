## Notes

There are many alternatives, like a [a *tiltrotor* mini talon](https://www.itsqv.com/QVM/index.php?title=X-UAV_Mini_Talon_VTOL_Project#Introduction), or a [tail sitter](https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/guide-tailsitter.html) which might be less robust and less stable, while being simpler and cheaper with only two motors and two servos.
