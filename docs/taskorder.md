# Task Order

Column notes:

* Parts reqd: Shows purchased parts from the parts list that are required for the task. It generally does not list parts that were used in a previous task. It also does not list tools etc.
* Involves: This may be useful for grouping tasks. For example, refer to it to concurrently do all of the tasks that require soldering.
* Est time: In minutes. The times might be way off. Some times, indicated by **, do not take into account time required for glue to dry, during the task.

## Round One
