Before sealing the heatshrink onto the wires, you can gently touch around one end of it (the end closest to the XT connector) with a soldering iron to slightly pre-shrink that end. Then it can slide into the end of the XT connector for a better seal. Finally, use a heat gun to shrink the entire tube.
