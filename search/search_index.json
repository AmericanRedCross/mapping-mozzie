Description: 90\u00b0 Single Angle Pattern Bracket, Dimensions 1.5\" x 1.5\" x 1.5\", 0.09\" thick, 13gm, $2. Two smaller brackets are also used. One is used to hold the front-end of the flight controller. The other is used to hold the pitot tube for the airspeed sensor. The smaller brackets were discontinued by the Servocity , however a simpler version can be 3d printed from the files from this project. (Print 2 of the small brackets.) Alternately, fabricate the brackets from aluminum angle. If you fabricate the two small brackets, note that not all holes in the image below need to be drilled in each bracket. For the pitot tube bracket, you only need the 5 \"bottom\" holes plus the larger .16\" dia hole. For the flight controller bracket, you only need the two \"top\" holes.

Strip a few mm of insulation from ONE end of each wire. The other end will be stripped at a later step. Prior to soldering, connect the female and male connectors together in order to prevent deformation. Put tape over the end you aren't soldering to avoid soldering the wrong end. Solder the stripped end of the red cable to the + side of the connector (and solder black to -). cut 2 pieces of heat shrink. One at time, slide a piece over the wire where it was soldered. Slide it into the connector. You can gently touch around one end of it (the end closest to the XT connector) with a soldering iron to slightly pre-shrink that end. Then it can slide into the end of the XT connector for a better seal. Then use a heat gun to shrink the entire tube. Label the connector (per the table) for future reference.
